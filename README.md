***
###  1. <a href=https://github.com/Darius-D/Insectic/tree/master/InsecticDatabaseApi> My InsecticAPI Project</a> Contains Three controllers that connect to my Database to perfrorm all C.R.U.D operations. This is intended to the the "middleman" between my DB and Web application. 

###  2.<a href=https://github.com/Darius-D/Insectic/blob/master/InsecticApiTests/TicketControllerTests.cs> My Test Project</a> These tests are made to check my API calls. I am in the process of making Unit tests utilizing Xunit and Moq to test my controllers without modifying my DB. 


###  3. <a href=https://github.com/Darius-D/Insectic/tree/master/Insectic> My Web application<a/>This is the user interface for this whole project. I want this UI to be fun and interactive. Do achieve that, I have created sticky notes that can be edited by the user on client side. I am also making a scrum board utilizing drag and drop features.
