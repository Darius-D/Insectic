## <p align="center" > Curent working features </p>

<p> This is currently my dashboard AKA my CorkBoard. This has links that look like post-it notes that scale and rotate upon hovering. The footer has stickey notes that the user can 
  edit with a simple double click. The stickey notes have a overflow of auto allowing for a the stickey note to hold unlimited amounts of characters with out modifying the view. Mulitiple media queries allow this page to be mobile friendly periodically removing elements as screen size shrinks. With mobile phones, only the nav links will be available to allow the user to make tickets, view tickets and manage team members. </p> 
  <p> The table is currently a work in porgess as I will need to use Javascript to find a way to make the scroll work on the table without altering the page layout.</p>

 ##  <p align="center"> Prototype Ticket Submission View
  <p> The Ticket submission view has yet to be formated to work with my default layout; this explains why my top navbar does not yet match my Home page. This will be corrected in the next "push". The ticket page has user input validation in all required fields ensureing an error comes up prior to the HTTP post action method being called. This will ensure no data the user entered is lost due to page refresh. Currently the 'textarea' tag is causing complications do to the lack of reactivity with the CSS grid layout. This will be corrected by media queries in the next "push". The Ticket submission view will retain the footer editable notes functionality. Java script will be used to store the note details to users cache files to ensure they remain the same upon view transfers.  </p>
