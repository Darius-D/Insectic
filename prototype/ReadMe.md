<p> This is currently my dashboard AKA my CorkBoard. This has links that look like post-it notes that scale upon hovering. The footer has stickey notes that the user can 
  edit with a simple double click. The stickey notes have a overflow of auto allowing for a the stickey note to hold unlimited amounts of characters with out modifying the view.</p> 
  <p> The table is currently a work in porgess as I will need to use Javascript to find a way to make the scroll work on the table without altering the page layout.</p>
